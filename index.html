        <h3>Alien (1979)</h3>
        <p>
          Ripley is introduced as a warrant officer aboard the Nostromo, a
          spaceship en route to Earth from Thedus. Having been placed in stasis
          for the long journey home, the crew is awakened when the Nostromo
          receives a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid.
          Following their landing, an unknown creature infiltrates the ship, and
          kills every other member of the crew. Ripley is the only member to
          escape from the Nostromo prior to its explosion, which she
          deliberately commenced to kill the monster. However, she discovers
          that the Alien is also aboard the ship's shuttle, but expels it into
          space before putting herself in stasis for the return trip to Earth.

        <h3>Aliens: Colonial Marines (2013)</h3>
        <p>
          Ripley has two cameos in the "Stasis Interrupted" DLC for the game. In
          this prequel campaign, Ripley is seen being impregnated by a
          facehugger and also appeared recreating the same final scene of Alien
          3. The game also revealed that Hicks actually survived the events of
          Alien 3 as he was retrieved by another Colonial Marines team, with the
          body in the stasis chamber that crashed being another marine who was
          knocked into Hicks' pod during a firefight, dying when the EEV
          crashed. Ripley, Newt and Bishop's pods were ejected while Hicks had
          to go with the other Marines.
